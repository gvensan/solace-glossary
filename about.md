Solace enables the smart movement of data so innovators can focus on doing what they do best—whether that’s leading IT organizations from the C-suite, architecting systems to meet ever-changing business requirements, or developing kickass enterprise, IoT and mobile applications.

Here is an attempt to consolidate relevant Solace and related technology terms in one place that can serve as a reference. This will ensure that all stakeholders (business and technical) understand what is meant by the terminology, acronyms, and phrases used in Solace.  We will continue to maintain this as the product and usecases evolve.
