title: "XA Transaction"
excerpt: "XA is a two-phase commit protocol that is natively supported by many databases and transaction monitors. It ensures data integrity by coordinating single transactions accessing multiple relational databases. The Resource Manager manages a particular resource such as a database or a JMS system. In addition, an XA Resource exposes a set of methods or functions for managing the resource."
