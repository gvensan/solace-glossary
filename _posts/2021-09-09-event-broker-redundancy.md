title: "Event Broker Redundancy"
excerpt: "Solace PubSub+ software event brokers support an active/standby redundancy model. With this model, a primary event broker provides messaging services to clients, while a backup event broker waits in standby modeâ€”it only provides service should the primary event broker fail. A third event broker acts as a monitoring node, to act as a tie-breaker and prevent split-brain scenarios that would otherwise cause both the primary and backup event broker to become active simultaneously."
