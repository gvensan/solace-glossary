title: "DMQ-eligibility"
excerpt: "Messages that are flagged as DMQ-eligible by the publishing client will be sent to the endpoint's DMQ rather than be discarded. However, if an endpoint's assigned DMQ doesn't exist, then the removed Guaranteed messages will still be discarded even if they are DMQ-eligible."
