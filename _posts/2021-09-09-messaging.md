title: "Messaging"
excerpt: "The term messaging refers to technology that lets computer systems share information without requiring either direct connections or awareness of each other's location. Messaging is also sometimes known as message-oriented middleware, or simply middleware<br/><br/>Messaging is analogous to postal and shipping services. Just as you would hand your letters or packages to a carrier and trust that they will get to where you want them to go, so it is with messaging—your applications hand off information to a messaging system that routes it to whatever other applications you’ve said you want it to get to.<br/><br/>At its most basic, messaging consists of the following:<br/>- publisher: the entity that sends or publishes the message (also called a producer<br/>- message: what the publisher wants to say to the subscriber. Messages often contain events, but can also carry queries, commands, and other information.<br/>- subscriber: the ultimate receiver of the message (also called a consumer)"
