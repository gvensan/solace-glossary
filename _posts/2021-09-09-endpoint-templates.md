title: "Endpoint Templates"
excerpt: "Endpoint templates are configurable objects that administrators can use to specify custom attributes and parameters for any new client created endpoints. Any custom configuration associated with the endpoint template will be applied to the client created endpoints based upon the endpoint name. You can associate multiple queues to an endpoint template; this means that the clients can use multiple templates to create endpoints with different characteristics."
