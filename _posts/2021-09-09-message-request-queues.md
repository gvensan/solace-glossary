title: "Message Request Queues"
excerpt: "Queues can control how message requests are processed<br/><br/>If the queue is created with non-exclusive access mode, consumers can load balance the processing of the message requests. Alternatively, the queue can be made exclusive so that only the first consumer will process requests and the other customers that bind act as backup should the first consumer disconnect."
