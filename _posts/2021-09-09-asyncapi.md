excerpt: "AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative that seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDA). Using AsyncAPI allows development teams to create applications that communicate asynchronously through events more easily. The core of AsyncAPI is a specification that describes how to create a document that explains the inner workings of an event-driven API."
