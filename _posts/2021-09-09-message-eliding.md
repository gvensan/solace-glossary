title: "Message Eliding"
excerpt: "Message eliding allows client applications to receive only the most current Direct messages published to topics that they subscribe to, at a rate they can manage, rather than queue up outdated messages. It can be useful in situations where there are slow consumers, or where a slower message rate is required. Only Direct messages can be elided."
