title: "Dynamically Provisioning Endpoints"
excerpt: "Endpoints can be provisioned in two ways:<br/><br/>a) An administrator can manually provision a durable endpoint through the Solace CLI or SolAdmin.<br/>b) In a connected Session, a client can dynamically provision a durable endpoint through the messaging API. To dynamically provision a durable endpoint, API call is made with endpoint properties and provision flags."
