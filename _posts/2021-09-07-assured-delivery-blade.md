excerpt: "On Solace appliance, this is a card which acts to ensure guaranteed delivery of messages, both in the persistent-sending case and the disconnected-client case. ADB has non-volatile memory (RAM) to spool message and deliver to active client without storing in hard disk. If client is offline then the messages get spooled in the SAN using HBA."
