title: "Rejection of Low-Priority Messages"
excerpt: "To protect against message congestion scenarios where such a large number of messages are published to a queue that system performance decreases, you can enable the queue to discard low‑priority messages but continue to spool high‑priority published messages. The queue can selectively discard low-priority messages only after the total number of low‑priority and high‑priority messages spooled exceeds the value set for the reject low‑priority message limit ."
