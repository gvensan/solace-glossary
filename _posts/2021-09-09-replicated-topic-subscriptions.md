title: "Replicated Topic Subscriptions"
excerpt: "To indicate which messages should be replicated between the active and standby site, you must configure a replicated topic subscription for a Message VPN. This topic pattern can be a topic subscription or a queue name subscription. If a published message matches both a replicated topic subscription and an endpoint on the active site, then the message is replicated to the standby site."
