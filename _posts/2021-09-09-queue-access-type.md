title: "Queue Access Type"
excerpt: "A queue has an access type, which determines how messages are delivered when multiple consumer flows are bound to it. Queues can be assigned one of the following access types:<br/>- Exclusive: Only one consumer can receive a message at any one time, while additional consumers may be connected as standby. <br/>- Non‑exclusive: Multiple consumers can bind to a non-exclusive queue. Each consumer is serviced in round‑robin fashion."
