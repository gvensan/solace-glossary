title: "Active Flow Indication"
excerpt: "If a queue has an exclusive access type, multiple clients can bind to the queue, but only one client at a time can actively receive messages from it. A Flow active event is returned to the client when its bound flow becomes the active flow which helps a client application to learn if it is the primary or backup consumer of an exclusive queue at runtime."
