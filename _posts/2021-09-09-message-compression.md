title: "Message Compression"
excerpt: "An application using Solace enterprise can enable the compression of message data sent between it and Solace PubSub+ so that message data is compressed before transmission and decompressed on reception.<br/><br/>Message compression reduces the size of message data frames to be transmitted over a network link. Reducing the size of a frame reduces the time required to transmit the frame across the network"
