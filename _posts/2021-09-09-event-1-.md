title: "Event (1)"
excerpt: "The event represents a business moment or an action that can be communicated with zero or more interested applications. The event is where you define metadata that describes and categorizes the event. An event is produced on a specific topic that must be defined for that event. From a modelling perspective, events reference payload schemas, and events are referenced by applications, thus forming the glue that binds applications together."
