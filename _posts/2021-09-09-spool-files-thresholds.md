title: "Spool Files Thresholds"
excerpt: "Guaranteed messages are spooled to an event broker through the use of internal spool files. If event brokerâ€™s spool files are all in use, it cannot receive any more messages until some messages are acknowledged, thereby freeing some spool files; any further ingress messages are discarded, and nacks are returned to the publishing clients to inform them of the discards.<br/><br/>Spool Files Thresholds setting indicates when events are generated to warn about the spool file usage."
