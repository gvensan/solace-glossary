title: "Event Promotion-Demotion"
excerpt: "When a Solace PubSub+ event broker using Guaranteed Messaging receives messages published to a topic, it can automatically change the delivery mode of the messages to accommodate the persistence requirements of an endpoint or a client subscription when there is a topic match. Changing message delivery modes is also known as message promotion and demotion."
