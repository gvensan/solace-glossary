title: "Event Orchestration"
excerpt: "To coordinate a sequence of actions being taken by there could be a master service dedicated to keeping track of all the other services, taking action if thereâ€™s an error. This approach is called orchestration, offering a single point of reference when tracing a problem, but also a single point of failure and a bottleneck."
