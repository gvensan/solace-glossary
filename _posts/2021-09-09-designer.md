excerpt: "Designer is a tool to design and view all aspects of your event-driven architectures. It is through Designer that you can create new events and associate the payload schema to these events. It provides a graphical representation of application domains, applications, schemas, and events. Designer is also used to visualize the interaction of events between applications and to provision your architecture into the Event Portal."
