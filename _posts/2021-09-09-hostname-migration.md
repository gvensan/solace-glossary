title: "Hostname Migration"
excerpt: "When there's a requirement to migrate the hostname from one event broker service to another. A common use case is when an event broker service is deleted, the hostname that was attached to the event broker service can be used for another event broker service so that previous client applications can connect using the same hostname."
