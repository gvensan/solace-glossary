title: "Queue Consumer"
excerpt: "In JMS, when a consumer binds to an exclusive queue, the messages that it can consume are filtered by the selector defined for the consumer. The messages excluded by the consumerâ€™s selector remain in the queue and can be consumed by subsequent consumers with different selectors or no selectors that might bind. Selectors act as egress filters on queues."
