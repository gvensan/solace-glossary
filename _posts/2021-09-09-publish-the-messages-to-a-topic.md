title: "Publish the messages to a topic"
excerpt: "A publish Guaranteed messages to a topic<br/>- Used for publish and subscribe models.<br/>- A Guaranteed message published to a topic is acknowledged by the Solace message bus to indicate that the system has received the message. A message that is published to a topic can be received by no clients, a single client, or multiple clients. If there is no subscriber for a message, that message is discarded because in this paradigm the producer and subscriber are decoupled."
