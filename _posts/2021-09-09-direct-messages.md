excerpt: "Direct messaging provides a reliable, but not guaranteed, delivery of messages from the Solace message bus to consuming clients, and is the default message delivery system for Solace PubSub+. It doesn't require any configuration beyond that required to set up and start other features. By default, direct messaging is always available to all clients connecting to an event broker."
