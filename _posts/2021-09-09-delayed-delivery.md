title: "Delayed Delivery"
excerpt: "Delayed delivery allows you to introduce a time delay between the time when a message is published to the event broker and the time when that message is delivered to a consumer. The delivery delay time is a configurable endpoint attribute. This allows a single message to be delivered to different consumers with different time delays."
