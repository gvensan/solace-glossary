title: "Schema"
excerpt: "In simple terms, a schema represents the contract to describe the payload of an event. Producers and consumers of an event can trust that the event's payload matches the schema definition assigned to that event. Schemas define a type of payload through JSON, AVRO, XML, Binary, or Text. JSON, AVRO, and XML schemas have content that describes each property of the schema. The content is either in JSON or AVRO Schema format, or XSD/DTD format."
