title: "Message Priority"
excerpt: "Message queues and topic endpoints can optionally support priority message delivery. When you enable an endpoint to respect message priority, the priority field in messages from publishers are respected for all guaranteed and promoted direct messages. In other words, the queue or topic endpoint delivers queued messages in priority order; meaning that all messages of a higher priority are delivered before any messages of a lower priority."
