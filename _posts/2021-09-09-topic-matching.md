title: "Topic Matching"
excerpt: "Messages are delivered to an endpoint when the published topic matches the topic subscription set for an endpoint (either a queue that has a topic subscription added to it or a topic endpoint). <br/><br/>It can automatically change the delivery mode of the messages to accommodate the persistence requirements of an endpoint or a client subscription when there is a topic match. Changing message delivery modes is also known as message promotion and demotion."
