title: "Event Sourcing"
excerpt: "The fundamental idea of Event Sourcing is that of ensuring every change to the state of an application is captured in an event object, and that these event objects are themselves stored in the sequence they were applied for the same lifetime as the application state itself.<br/><br/>Instead of the traditional way to persist an entity by saving its current state,  event-centric approach to persistence by storing a sequence of state changing events is employed."
