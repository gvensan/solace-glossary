title: "Respect Message TTL"
excerpt: "Respect message TTL, is a queue setting that ensures messages' TTL values are checked. If a messageâ€™s TTL is expired, it is either removed from the message spool and discarded, or, if the message is eligible for a DMQ, it is moved to a DMQ provisioned on the event broker. If a message does not have an assigned TTL, then it will never expire."
