title: "Event Filtering"
excerpt: "Systems can have either managed subscriptions or consumer self-serve subscriptions. These subscriptions add fine-grained filtering to allow consumers to receive exactly the data they need from the mesh. Without this fine-grained filtering, intermediary processes in the system would be responsible for receiving, filtering, and re-publishing data."
