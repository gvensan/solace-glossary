title: "Rotating Password"
excerpt: "Password rotation refers to the changing/resetting of a password(s). Rotating a password for an event broker service updates the login credentials to the PubSub+ Broker Manager for that service. As a Cluster Manager Editor, you can rotate passwords for both Editor and Viewer roles. Rotating the password does not impact the PubSub+ Cloud login credentials."
