title: "Event Subscription"
excerpt: "While the event topic is metadata attached to the published event to allow for movement through an event mesh, the subscription is the mechanism for client applications to register interest in events. Upon matching event topics to consumer subscriptions, the system can weave dynamic forwarding paths across the mesh to deliver the correct events to each consumer."
