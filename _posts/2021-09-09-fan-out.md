title: "Fan-out"
excerpt: "Fan-out is the typical publish/subscribe scenario where a message is published once to the PubSub+ message broker and forwarded to multiple clients who have expressed interest in receiving messages of that kind through topic subscriptions. So the message is then fanned out to the clients by the PubSub+ message broker, and each client receives a copy of the message."
