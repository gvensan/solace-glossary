title: "Uncontrolled Fail-over"
excerpt: "An uncontrolled fail-over occurs due to a sudden loss of connectivity to a replication site with Message VPNs with a replication active state. When this occurs, only synchronous replication mode messages can be guaranteed not to be lost. Messages remaining in the replication queue will not be available at the disaster recovery site."
