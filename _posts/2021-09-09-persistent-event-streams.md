title: "Persistent Event Streams"
excerpt: "Event stream where messages are considered to be persistent if they are placed onto non-volatile storage media after they arrive on the broker. Persistent messages are suitable for application design patterns where the event messages must be:<br/><br/>- Processed in-order of receipt.<br/>- Available to consumers, even if those consumers are off-line.<br/>- Able to survive the loss of an event broker."
