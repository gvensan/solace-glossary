title: "Replay Log"
excerpt: "Message Replay allows published Guaranteed messages, and Direct messages promoted to Guaranteed, that were not rejected-to-publisher for any reason, to be stored in a replay log for an indefinite period after being received in case they need to be replayed at some later date. Messages are kept in the replay log until it's full, at which point, the oldest messages are discarded to free up space for new ones."
